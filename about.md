title: About Me
---
I am Zhiyuan Ma (马志远/Jerry), a Ph.D student in Department of Physics and
Astronomy, University of Missouri-Columbia.

I work with Dr. Haojing Yan, focusing on the formation and evolution of
galaxies. I am interested particularly in revealing the "hidden" episodes of
the star forming activities during the epoch of "cosmic noon", when the
universe was forming stars the most actively but heavily obscured by the dust.

As part of my PhD training, I have spent 200+ hrs at MDM observatory and
the WIYN observatory, on the mountain of Kitt Peak, AZ. To reducing the
collected data, as well as other archival datasets, I have gained substantial
experience in reducing observational datasets, spanning from optical to
far-infrared.

I use Python and C/C++ as my primary programming language for the research. I
also developed APUS, a tool to organize and automate complex data reduction
pipelines.

I use Vim, and like spaces over tabs. I like writing poems (in my
native language) and playing guitar. I also sing, but in a very disturbing way :D.
