![Me]({{ site.url }}/images/me-square.jpg){:style="float:right;margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:20px"}

I am Zhiyuan Ma (马志远/Jerry), a PhD student in Department of Physics and
Astronomy, University of Missouri-Columbia.

I work with Dr. Haojing Yan, focusing on the formation and evolution of
galaxies. I am interested particularly in revealing the "hidden" episodes of
the star forming activities during the epoch of "cosmic noon", when the
universe was forming stars the most actively but heavily obscured by the dust.

As part of my PhD training, I have spent 200+ hrs at the MDM observatory and
the WIYN observatory, on the mountain of Kitt Peak, AZ. Over the past few
years, I have gained substantial experience in reducing and analyzing various
kinds of astronomical datasets, spanning from optical to far-infrared. Using
these data, we are working on getting a comprehensive view of the so called
"ULIRG" population at z > 1, which gives important hints about how the universe
evolves to its current form.

I use Python and C/C++ as my primary programming language. I am also familiar
with most of the popular data reduction/analysis tools.

I am the author of APUS, a tool to organize and automate complex data
reduction pipelines. I also wrote CLaws, a simple GUI-based amateur CCD
controlling software that could inter-operate with professional tools like
DS9/IRAF.

I use Vim, and like spaces over tabs. I like writing poems (in my native
language) and playing guitar. I also sing, but an average audience may find it
a bit disturbing.
