title: About Me
---
I am Zhiyuan Ma (马志远, also known as Jerry), currently a Ph.D
student in Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of
Missouri-Columbia.

My research focuses on galaxy evolution and formation, particularly during the
epoch of "cosmic noon", when the universe was forming stars the most actively.

Not only I take data of our own using large telescopes, I also can get my hands
really dirty on reducing various archival data, you know, just like a child
playing mud.

I program a lot, both for work and for fun; I write poems (Chinese only); I
play guitar; I sing, but mostly in the very wrong way.
